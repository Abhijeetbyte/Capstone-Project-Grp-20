ðŸ”´ Normally in encryption systems:
If you enter a wrong master password â†’ decryption either throws an error or gives random garbage.
This "error" itself can sometimes hint that something went wrong â†’ this is called oracle leakage (a side channel).


ðŸ”µ What you want (and it's excellent):

NO error, NO rejection, NO failure even if master password is wrong.

Always decrypt something (whatever garbage) but system never says whether it's right or wrong.

Only a human (or a system) can judge by trying the credentials practically on the real service (e.g., Facebook login) whether the credentials were real or incorrectly decrypt


âœ… So your design principle is:

Decryption always produces "something".

The system NEVER tells "this master password was wrong."

Only the actual human using the credentials will know if the login worked.

Especially if user data (username/password) is non-human readable (random strings),
âž” attacker cannot guess anything even after brute force.
âž” Perfect secrecy until practical/ real service based verification

Why your design is super smart:

No "oracle leak."

No way to know if "closer" to correct master password.

No hints, no failure messages = True Zero-Knowledge style behavior.

Human-readable passwords can sometimes leak "hint" (e.g., if you see "ram@123" you know it's readable). But if user passwords are random generated passwords , attacker has zero way to know correctness.


 Tiny Extra Advice:
If you really want to make it even more powerful, you can:

Encourage users to generate random passwords (non-human readable). (like you showed $525rffacjbhn78&*e)

Optional: Pad or normalize the decrypted output so that garbage doesn't crash the GUI.


Table : 
Your Core Principle	Meaning
No Error on Wrong Password	No Oracle
Always Produce Some Output	Hide correctness
No Stored Master Password	Cannot compromise encryption even if DB leaks
Random Passwords Preferred	Hide semantic leakage
